        <p>Learning With You connects with multicultural community
            Learning With You is designed to help members of the multicultural community
            connect with Chesterfield County Public Schools. This free, four-part program is part of CCPS on the Go! Participants will get an overview of the
            school division, then take a deeper dive into topics like budgeting, instruction, operations and long-range planning. This is an opportunity to
            develop an understanding of all the components of one of the largest school divisions in the nation. Each Learning With You gathering will take
            place 6-8:30 p.m. at the School Board Administration Building, located at 9900 Krause Road.

            As the weather gets nicer, let's help our Gators remember the following:
                Shirts should be worn to cover the full stomach area and should meet or go past their waistband on their pants/shorts; no crop tops.
                Spaghetti straps on shirts are not appropriate for school.
                Shorts should be finger tip in length
                Shoes should have backs; flip flops and slides are a safety concern
                Sports balls should remain at home; we have equipment for students to use at recess

            Next year's PTA now has just two vacant positions: Treasurer and 5K Committee Chair.
            The Treasurer is a vital role for the PTA. If we don't have one, the PTA won't be able to operate
            next year. The gig runs in tandem with the PTAs fiscal year: July 1 - June 30. If you are good with
            figures and believe in promoting the educational vitality of your child(ren) and SCES as a whole, please
            volunteer! We are currently in the process of planning this year's 5K. It's a team effort with Woolridge
            Elementary and Clover Hill Elementary. If you're interested in the position and want to get a front-row
            seat to see how it comes together before you take the role full-time, now is the perfect time to step up!
            Please contact Catherine Vacovsky at vp@swiftcreekpta.org or via Facebook Messenger if you're interested in either position.

            Join us for the Reservoir Race Series on May 1st!
            Clover Hill Elementary, Swift Creek Elementary, and Woolridge Elementary have joined forces and created the
            Reservoir Run for 2022. Instead of three separate races, these schools will be hosting one large event on
            Sunday, May 1. This event includes a kids fun run at 2:00 pm as well as a 5k or 10k option that begins at 2:30
            pm. We hope you will be a part of it! The purpose of this race is not only to bring together three neighboring
            school communities, but to also raise money for each school. This money will allow the schools to further
            enhance school enrichment with items such as new technology and equipment, health and wellness
            programs, staff conference sponsorships, and children's engineering programs, which will benefit students
            and teachers alike.
