                            school division, then take a deeper dive into topics like budgeting, instruction, operations and long-range planning. This is an opportunity to
                            develop an understanding of all the components of one of the largest school divisions in the nation. <p>Each Learning With You gathering will take
                            place 6-8:30 p.m. at the School Board Administration Building, located at 9900 Krause Road.</p>

                            Reservoir Run for 2022. Instead of three separate races, these schools will be hosting one large event on
                            <span>Sunday, May 1</span>. This event includes a kids fun run at 2:00 pm as well as a 5k or 10k option that begins at 2:30
                            pm. We hope you will be a part of it!</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The purpose of this race is not only to bring together three neighboring
                            school communities, but to also raise money for each school. This money will allow the schools to further
                            enhance school enrichment with items such as new technology and equipment, health and wellness
                            programs, staff conference sponsorships, and children's engineering programs, which will benefit students

                Next year's PTA now has just two vacant positions: <span>Treasurer</span> and <span>5K Committee Chair</span>.
                <p>The Treasurer is a vital role for the PTA. If we don't have one, the PTA won't be able to operate
                next year. The gig runs in tandem with the PTAs fiscal year: July 1 - June 30. If you are good with
                figures and believe in promoting the educational vitality of your child(ren) and SCES as a whole, please
                volunteer!</p>
                
                <p>We are currently in the process of planning this year's 5K. It's a team effort with Woolridge
                Elementary and Clover Hill Elementary. If you're interested in the position and want to get a front-row
                seat to see how it comes together before you take the role full-time, now is the perfect time to step up!
                Please contact Catherine Vacovsky at <a href="mailto:vp@swiftcreekpta.org">vp@swiftcreekpta.org</a> or via Facebook Messenger if you're interested in either position.</p>
