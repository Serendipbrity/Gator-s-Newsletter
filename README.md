# Gators-Newsletter
A school newsletter to help parents better nagivate important information and upcoming events.

# User Story
As a parent or guardian of a child of Swift Creek Elementary School

I want a weekly newsletter that is mobile-friendly

And gives me important information on the upcoming week.

# Acceptance Criteria
When I open the newsletter on any device

I can see what today’s lunch will be

I can see a calendar of events at the school for the upcoming week

I can navigate to any section of the newsletter

So that I can reference only what I want to read easily

There are clickable links in the newsletter

So that I can take action on any event I am interested in.

# Problem Statement/How it Works
The current weekly newsletter parents/guardians receive is built in Google Docs, and it is not mobile-friendly. It is also a “dumping ground” for all the information teachers/administrators/school volunteers want to push to their audience, and over time it becomes increasingly unorganized, therefore hard to follow and less likely to be acted upon.

We sought to build a newsletter webpage that an elementary school can send out to their students’ parents and guardians on a weekly basis. The page will have both timely topics that pertain to the week ahead as well as more “evergreen” content that will stay on the page through most of the school year.

Our newsletter features a navbar that allows users to pick and choose what they would like to read. The timeliest information is at the top, starting with a button that allows users to figure out what lunch is being served that day (using API) followed by an interactive Google Calendar of upcoming school events. 

Using UIkit, we streamlined the design through their card and accordion component features. The information presented is mobile-friendly, courtesy of UIkit and CSS. The color scheme for the newsletter is in pleasing school colors. Links on the newsletter are clickable using HTML. Moment.js powers the current date display.

While one may argue that if the school were to implement such a newsletter they would need a web developer to maintain it. While that may be true to an extent, any developer with a basic understanding (through 8 weeks of the coding bootcamp), if given text and photo content, could update the newsletter in ~1 hour. That could be a relief for a school administrator toiling with properties on Google Docs!
