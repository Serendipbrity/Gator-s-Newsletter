                9 AM - 1 PM

                As the weather gets nicer, let's help our Gators remember the following:
                    Shirts should be worn to cover the full stomach area and should meet or go past their waistband on their pants/shorts; no crop tops.
                    Spaghetti straps on shirts are not appropriate for school.
                    Shorts should be finger tip in length
                    Shoes should have backs; flip flops and slides are a safety concern
                    Sports balls should remain at home; we have equipment for students to use at recess.

                Next year's PTA now has just two vacant positions: Treasurer and 5K Committee Chair.
                The Treasurer is a vital role for the PTA. If we don't have one, the PTA won't be able to operate
                next year. The gig runs in tandem with the PTAs fiscal year: July 1 - June 30. If you are good with
                figures and believe in promoting the educational vitality of your child(ren) and SCES as a whole, please
                volunteer! We are currently in the process of planning this year's 5K. It's a team effort with Woolridge
                Elementary and Clover Hill Elementary. If you're interested in the position and want to get a front-row
                seat to see how it comes together before you take the role full-time, now is the perfect time to step up!
                Please contact Catherine Vacovsky at <a href="mailto:vp@swiftcreekpta.org">vp@swiftcreekpta.org</a> or via Facebook Messenger if you're interested in either position.

                 ~ Go NUTS for READING ~
                Families - If you know you will be taking your child to the reading night, you may
                purchase your family tickets using THIS LINK. They are general admissions, but will still
                have a seat/section number for Swift Creek ES. We will all be able to sit together.
                **The actual FREE student tickets will be dispersed the week we come back from Spring
                Break.**

                Learning With You connects with multicultural community
                Learning With You is designed to help members of the multicultural community
                connect with Chesterfield County Public Schools. This free, four-part program is part of CCPS on the Go! Participants will get an overview of the
                school division, then take a deeper dive into topics like budgeting, instruction, operations and long-range planning. This is an opportunity to
                develop an understanding of all the components of one of the largest school divisions in the nation. Each Learning With You gathering will take
                place 6-8:30 p.m. at the School Board Administration Building, located at 9900 Krause Road. </br></br>
        
                Join us for the Reservoir Race Series on May 1st!
                Clover Hill Elementary, Swift Creek Elementary, and Woolridge Elementary have joined forces and created the
                Reservoir Run for 2022. Instead of three separate races, these schools will be hosting one large event on
                Sunday, May 1. This event includes a kids fun run at 2:00 pm as well as a 5k or 10k option that begins at 2:30
                pm. We hope you will be a part of it! The purpose of this race is not only to bring together three neighboring
                school communities, but to also raise money for each school. This money will allow the schools to further
                enhance school enrichment with items such as new technology and equipment, health and wellness
                programs, staff conference sponsorships, and children's engineering programs, which will benefit students
                and teachers alike.</br></br>
      
                SOL TIME IS GATOR SPEED AHEAD!
                While we know this is WAY ahead -- that's on purpose. We want to give families as much time as possible
                to plan! We know that students do best when they take the test as scheduled and as planned so â€¦ HERE'S THE SCHEDULE! Please do
                your very best to be mindful of trips/appointments or anything that might overcommit our Gators during testing! We can't wait to finally be able to Show
                Off Great Gator Learning! They have earned this time to SHINE!</br></br>          
        
                Watch Dogs
                We are excited to invite our Watch Dogs back into the building, following
                the volunteer protocols. (See volunteer link below.)
                Watch Dogs are positive, male role models who support our Gators during
                the school day.
                If you would like to sign up to be a WatchDog, the sign up is located
                HERE.
